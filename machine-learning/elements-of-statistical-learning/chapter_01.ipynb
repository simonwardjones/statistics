    "In a typical **supervised** scenario, we have outcomes, usually quantitative/categorical that we wish to predict based on a set of features. We have a training set of data, in which we observe the outcome and feature. We build a prediction model, or learner, which will enable us to predict the outcome for new unseen objects. \n",
