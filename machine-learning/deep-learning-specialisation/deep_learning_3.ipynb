    "- Define a single evaluation metric and potentially other satisfying metrics.\n",
    "- Split data into training, validation and test sets.\n",
    "  - Iterate on training and development sets to improve performance.\n",
    "  - Dev and test sets should come from the same distribution and be representative of the data the model will see in production.\n",
    "  - Use test set to evaluate performance.\n",
    "  - If the data size is very large use a more skewed 98/1/1% split\n",
    "- For some problems understanding `human level performance` is a good proxy for understanding the best possible performance (`Bayes optimal error`). With this, better error analysis can be done pointing out whether it is a bias or variance problem. `Avoidable bias` is the difference between the human level performance (what we want to achieve) and the training error. `Variance` is the difference between the training error and the development error.\n",
    "- Look at individual examples and understand the causes of error.\n",
    "- Break the examples into groups and look at the causes of error.\n",
    "- Build your first system quickly, then iterate.\n",
    "- When extra data is available but from a different distribution - it can help but it is best to leave the dev and test sets as they are as they are representative of the data the model will see in production.\n",
    "- Transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained model is used as a starting point for a new task perhaps training only the last layer or two.\n",
    "- Multi-task learning is a technique where a single model is used to solve multiple related problems for example predicting whether a user will click on an ad or not and whether they will buy a product.\n",
    "- End-to-end learning is a technique where the problem is approached as a single problem and a model is trained to solve it from start to finish."
